      foods. The pleasantly spicy \u201ckick\u201d from the root of Zingiber officinale,
      the ginger plant, is what makes ginger ale, ginger tea, candies and many Asian
      dishes so appealing.\n\nWhat is ginger good for?\nIn addition to great taste,
      ginger provides a range of health benefits that you can enjoy in many forms.
      Here\u2019s what you should know about all the ways ginger can add flavor to
      your food and support your well-being.\n\nHealth Benefits of Ginger\nGinger
      is not just delicious. Gingerol, a natural component of ginger root, benefits
      gastrointestinal motility \u2015 the rate at which food exits the stomach and
      continues along the digestive process. Eating ginger encourages efficient digestion,
      so food doesn\u2019t linger as long in the gut.\n\nNausea relief. Encouraging
      stomach emptying can relieve the discomforts of nausea due to:\nChemotherapy.
      Experts who work with patients receiving chemo for cancer, say ginger may take
      the edge off post-treatment nausea, and without some of the side effects of
      anti-nausea medications.\nPregnancy. For generations, women have praised the
      power of ginger to ease \u201cmorning sickness\u201d and other queasiness associated
      with pregnancy. Even the American Academy of Obstetrics and Gynecology mentions
      ginger as an acceptable nonpharmaceutical remedy for nausea and vomiting.\nBloating
      and gas. Eating ginger can cut down on fermentation, constipation and other
      causes of bloating and intestinal gas.\nWear and tear on cells. Ginger contains
      antioxidants. These molecules help manage free radicals, which are compounds
      that can damage cells when their numbers grow too high.\nIs ginger anti-inflammatory?
      It is possible. Ginger contains over 400 natural compounds, and some of these
      are anti-inflammatory. More studies will help us determine if eating ginger
      has any impact on conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis or respiratory inflammation.\nGinger
      Tea Benefits\nGinger tea is fantastic in cold months, and delicious after dinner.
      You can add a little lemon or lime, and a small amount of honey and make a great
      beverage.\n\nCommercial ginger tea bags are available at many grocery stores
      and contain dry ginger, sometimes in combination with other ingredients. These
      tea bags store well and are convenient to brew. Fresh ginger has strong health
      benefits comparable to those of dried, but tea made with dried ginger may have
      a milder flavor.\n\nMaking ginger root tea with fresh ginger takes a little
      more preparation but tends to deliver a more intense, lively brew.\n\nHow to
      Make Ginger Tea\n\nIt\u2019s easy:\n\nBuy a piece of fresh ginger.\nTrim off
      the tough knots and dry ends.\nCarefully peel it.\nCut it into thin, crosswise
      slices.\nPut a few of the slices in a cup or mug.\nPour in boiling water and
      cover.\nTo get all the goodness of the ginger, let the slices steep for at least
      10 minutes.\n\nGinger tea is a healthier alternative to ginger ale, ginger beer
      and other commercial canned or bottled ginger beverages. These drinks provide
      ginger\u2019s benefits, but many contain a lot of sugar. It may be better to
      limit these to occasional treats or choose sugar-free options.\n\nGinger Root
      Versus Ginger Powder\nBoth forms contain all the health benefits of ginger.
      Though it\u2019s hard to beat the flavor of the fresh root, ginger powder is
      nutritious, convenient and economical.\n\nFresh ginger lasts a while in the
      refrigerator and can be frozen after you have peeled and chopped it. The powder
      has a long shelf life and is ready to use without peeling and chopping.\u201d\n\nGinger
      paste can stay fresh for about two months when properly stored, either in the
      refrigerator or freezer.\n\nShould you take a ginger supplement?\nGinger supplements
      aren\u2019t necessary, and experts recommend that those who want the health
      benefits of ginger enjoy it in food and beverages instead of swallowing ginger
      pills, which may contain other, unnoted ingredients.\n\nThey point out that
      in general, the supplement industry is not well regulated, and it can be hard
      for consumers to know the quantity, quality and added ingredients in commercially
      available nutrition supplements.\n\nFor instance, the Food and Drug Administration
      only reviews adverse reports on nutrition supplements. People should be careful
      about nutrition supplements in general, and make sure their potency and ingredients
      have been vetted by a third party, not just the manufacturer.\n\nHow to Eat
      Ginger\nIn addition to tea, plenty of delicious recipes include ginger in the
      form of freshly grated or minced ginger root, ginger paste or dry ginger powder.\n\nGinger
      can balance the sweetness of fruits and the flavor is great with savory dishes,
      such as lentils.\n\nPickled ginger, the delicate slices often served with sushi,
      is another option. The sweet-tart-spicy condiment provides the healthy components
      of ginger together with the probiotic benefit of pickles. And, compared to other
      pickled items, pickled ginger is not as high in sodium.\n\nGinger Side Effects\nResearch
      shows that ginger is safe for most people to eat in normal amounts \u2014 such
      as those in food and recipes. However, there are a couple of concerns.\n\nHigher
      doses, such as those in supplements, may increase risk of bleeding. The research
      isn\u2019t conclusive, but people on anti-coagulant therapy (blood thinners
      such as warfarin, aspirin and others) may want to be cautious.\n\nStudies are
      exploring if large amounts of ginger may affect insulin and lower blood sugar,
      so until more is known, people with diabetes can enjoy normal quantities of
      ginger in food but should steer clear of large-dose ginger supplements.\n\nFor
      any questions about ginger or any other food ingredient and how it might affect
      your health, a clinical dietitian can provide information and guidance.", "id":

      a concise manner."}], "documents": [{"text": "Ginger adds a fragrant zest to
      both sweet and savory foods. The pleasantly spicy \u201ckick\u201d from the
      root of Zingiber officinale, the ginger plant, is what makes ginger ale, ginger
      tea, candies and many Asian dishes so appealing.\n\nWhat is ginger good for?\nIn
      addition to great taste, ginger provides a range of health benefits that you
      can enjoy in many forms. Here\u2019s what you should know about all the ways
      ginger can add flavor to your food and support your well-being.\n\nHealth Benefits
      of Ginger\nGinger is not just delicious. Gingerol, a natural component of ginger
      root, benefits gastrointestinal motility \u2015 the rate at which food exits
      the stomach and continues along the digestive process. Eating ginger encourages
      efficient digestion, so food doesn\u2019t linger as long in the gut.\n\nNausea
      relief. Encouraging stomach emptying can relieve the discomforts of nausea due
      to:\nChemotherapy. Experts who work with patients receiving chemo for cancer,
      say ginger may take the edge off post-treatment nausea, and without some of
      the side effects of anti-nausea medications.\nPregnancy. For generations, women
      have praised the power of ginger to ease \u201cmorning sickness\u201d and other
      queasiness associated with pregnancy. Even the American Academy of Obstetrics
      and Gynecology mentions ginger as an acceptable nonpharmaceutical remedy for
      nausea and vomiting.\nBloating and gas. Eating ginger can cut down on fermentation,
      constipation and other causes of bloating and intestinal gas.\nWear and tear
      on cells. Ginger contains antioxidants. These molecules help manage free radicals,
      which are compounds that can damage cells when their numbers grow too high.\nIs
      ginger anti-inflammatory? It is possible. Ginger contains over 400 natural compounds,
      and some of these are anti-inflammatory. More studies will help us determine
      if eating ginger has any impact on conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis or
      respiratory inflammation.\nGinger Tea Benefits\nGinger tea is fantastic in cold
      months, and delicious after dinner. You can add a little lemon or lime, and
      a small amount of honey and make a great beverage.\n\nCommercial ginger tea
      bags are available at many grocery stores and contain dry ginger, sometimes
      in combination with other ingredients. These tea bags store well and are convenient
      to brew. Fresh ginger has strong health benefits comparable to those of dried,
      but tea made with dried ginger may have a milder flavor.\n\nMaking ginger root
      tea with fresh ginger takes a little more preparation but tends to deliver a
      more intense, lively brew.\n\nHow to Make Ginger Tea\n\nIt\u2019s easy:\n\nBuy
      a piece of fresh ginger.\nTrim off the tough knots and dry ends.\nCarefully
      peel it.\nCut it into thin, crosswise slices.\nPut a few of the slices in a
      cup or mug.\nPour in boiling water and cover.\nTo get all the goodness of the
      ginger, let the slices steep for at least 10 minutes.\n\nGinger tea is a healthier
      alternative to ginger ale, ginger beer and other commercial canned or bottled
      ginger beverages. These drinks provide ginger\u2019s benefits, but many contain
      a lot of sugar. It may be better to limit these to occasional treats or choose
      sugar-free options.\n\nGinger Root Versus Ginger Powder\nBoth forms contain
      all the health benefits of ginger. Though it\u2019s hard to beat the flavor
      of the fresh root, ginger powder is nutritious, convenient and economical.\n\nFresh
      ginger lasts a while in the refrigerator and can be frozen after you have peeled
      and chopped it. The powder has a long shelf life and is ready to use without
      peeling and chopping.\u201d\n\nGinger paste can stay fresh for about two months
      when properly stored, either in the refrigerator or freezer.\n\nShould you take
      a ginger supplement?\nGinger supplements aren\u2019t necessary, and experts
      recommend that those who want the health benefits of ginger enjoy it in food
      and beverages instead of swallowing ginger pills, which may contain other, unnoted
      ingredients.\n\nThey point out that in general, the supplement industry is not
      well regulated, and it can be hard for consumers to know the quantity, quality
      and added ingredients in commercially available nutrition supplements.\n\nFor
      instance, the Food and Drug Administration only reviews adverse reports on nutrition
      supplements. People should be careful about nutrition supplements in general,
      and make sure their potency and ingredients have been vetted by a third party,
      not just the manufacturer.\n\nHow to Eat Ginger\nIn addition to tea, plenty
      of delicious recipes include ginger in the form of freshly grated or minced
      ginger root, ginger paste or dry ginger powder.\n\nGinger can balance the sweetness
      of fruits and the flavor is great with savory dishes, such as lentils.\n\nPickled

      sweet-tart-spicy condiment provides the healthy components of ginger together
      with the probiotic benefit of pickles. And, compared to other pickled items,
      pickled ginger is not as high in sodium.\n\nGinger Side Effects\nResearch shows

      doses, such as those in supplements, may increase risk of bleeding. The research
